about= <h2>Who maintains this web site?</h2>\
        This web site is created and maintained by a team of researchers, who investigates the software monocultures and software\
        diversity on the web. The research team is financially supported by the\
        <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="http://diversify-project.eu">DIVERSIFY European project</a> and by a grant\
        from the <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="http://www.insa-rennes.fr/en.html">INSA-Rennes school</a>.\
        The site is hosted at the <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="http://www.inria.fr/en/centre/rennes">INRIA Rennes\
        Bretagne-Atlantique research center</a> and the\
        <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="http://www.irisa.fr/en">IRISA lab</a>.\
        <h2>What is the purpose of this web site?</h2>\
        <h3>Inform users about their position within the web ecosystem</h3>\
        With this web site, we aim at providing users with some basic information about their configuration and\
        how trackable it is. We also want to exploit the data we collect to advise users about how they can be more\
        similar to others and thus be less trackable.\
        <h3>Investigate the diversity of fingerprints</h3>\
        The research question we investigate is: how can we automatically reconfigure a user's platform to\
        fuzz the device fingerprint in a realistic manner? The degree of realism is important to prevent users\
        of our solution to be detected as such. The collection of a large base of real fingerprints will allow us to tune our\
        solution towards platforms that are as different as possible yet not distinguishable as "strange" configurations.

privacy=  <br><p>The goal of this project is to measure and study the diversity of web browsers and establish statistical\
    profiles of browser fingerprints. All of the data for the project will be collected in an anonymized\
    form which ensures that it is not Personally Identifiable Information*, nor otherwise likely to lead to\
    the identification or tracking of any web users.</p>\
<p>*Personally identifiable information (PII) is any data that could potentially identify a specific individual.</p>\
<p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our website. In this policy, "we" refers to the INRIA\
    researchers and students who are bound to keep information they receive confidential.</p>\
<h2>Information Gathered by the amiunique Website</h2>\
<p>For the needs of the research project defined <a href="/about">here</a>, amiunique collects anonymous data about the\
configuration of computers, operating systems, browsers and plugins. If you click the "View my fingerprint" button, this\
type of information will be collected from your browser. Although these kinds of data may form a `fingerprint' that\
could in principle be combined with information about page requests and identifying details in order to track people's\
browsing habits, we will <strong>never</strong> do so.</p>\

<p>In addition to these data, we collect several kinds of `housekeeping' information to assist us in analyzing the\
    fingerprint data. The housekeeping information is:\
    <ul>\
        <li>Cookies</li>\
        <li>Encrypted IP addresses</li>\
        <li>Timestamps</li>\
    </ul>\
<p>Our practices and purposes for collecting these housekeeping records are discussed below:\
<h3>Cookies</h3>\
<p>amiunique sets a cookie that persists for 4 months for the purpose of determining how often browser characteristics change, and\
how often they stay the same, when a browser returns over time. If your browser is configured to accept cookies, and you return to\
amiunique several times, the cookie will be used to link the data from your visits together so that we can study the natural evolution of\
browser fingerprints.\
If you want to disable/enable browser cookies, click on the link below corresponding to your browser for instructions.\
You should be aware that entirely disabling cookies may block some interactive features on some websites (most notably, automatic logins).\
<p>Instructions for:\
<ul>\
    <li><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/cookies-faq">Microsoft Windows Explorer</a></li>\
    <li><a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95647&p=cpn_cookies">Google Chrome</a></li>\
    <li><a href="http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/Enabling%20and%20disabling%20cookies">Mozilla Firefox</a></li>\
    <li><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ph17191">Apple Safari</a></li>\
    <li><a href="http://www.opera.com/help/tutorials/security/cookies/">Opera browser</a></li>\
</ul>\
Moreover, if you are interested in enabling/disabling Flash cookies, you can do so by visiting the following page:\
<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html#118539">Manage\
    Flash cookies</a>.\
<h3>IP addresses</h3>\
amiunique does not log IP addresses, but we do compute hashes of each IP address. This hashed IP will allow us to collect an anonymous dataset\
about how often browsers that change IP address could have been followed using a fingerprint.\
<h3>Timestamps</h3>\
amiunique collects a "fuzzy" timestamp, rounded to the nearest hour, each time it is visited. This will be used to measure how fast browser\
fingerprints change, but for no other purpose.\
<h2>Our Use of Information from amiunique</h2>\
We will analyze the collected data in order to establish what are realistic profiles for browser fingerprints. The purpose of this analysis is\
to set an automatic procedure to proactively diversify user platforms in a realistic manner.\
amiunique has no Third-Party Service Providers.\
<h2>Sharing of amiunique data</h2>\
We may publish or share aggregated, statistical data from the amiunique project in order to facilitate privacy research, educate people about\
privacy problems, and to aid in the development of privacy-enhancing technologies. We have gone to great lengths to ensure that amiunique does\
not produce any records about anyone's browsing habits or the identities of any individual visitors, so we will never be in a position where we\
could share any such records.\
<h2>Security</h2>\
In a general way, INRIA commits to carry out technical and organizational means to protect all information we gathered against illegal or\
fortuitous destruction, fortuitous loss, alteration, diffusion or unauthorized access. Nevertheless, INRIA shall be required to divulgate any\
information to comply with any applicable law or rules, or to respond to any administrative or judiciary order.\
<p>Although we make good faith efforts to store information collected in a secure operating environment, we cannot guarantee complete security.\
    Information collected will be maintained for a length of time appropriate to the needs of this research project.\
